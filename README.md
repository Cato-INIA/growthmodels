# growthmodels: Nonlinear Growth Models

`growthmodels` is a `R` package that contains a compilation of nonlinear growth models used in many areas.

## Installation

To install the stable version of `growthmodels` from CRAN, simply run the following from an R console:

```
install.packages('growthmodels')
```

To install the latest development builds of `growthmodels` directly from GitHub, run this instead:

```
require(devtools)
install_github('growthmodels', 'drodriguezperez')
```
